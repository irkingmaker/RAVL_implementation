Implementation of relaxed AVL tree data structure-

Implementation is based on "Deletion without rebalancing in binary search trees" 
by Siddhartha Sen et al

ravl.c - C implementation of the paper.

duplicate_ravl.c - C implementation of ravl with handling of duplicates.

firstfit_ravl.c - C implementation of ravl with deleting a node based on first fit algorithm.

best_fit_ravl.c - C implementation of ravl with deleting a node based on best fit algorithm.

fragmentation_firstfit_ravl.c - C implementation of ravl with first fit and fragmentation.

fragmentation_bestfit_ravl.c - C implementation of ravl with best fit and fragmentation.
